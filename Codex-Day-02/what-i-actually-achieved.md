# 🚀 Day 02 - 30-Day Coding Challenge  
## ✅ Progress Summary  

### 📌 Focus Areas:
- Set up Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Wrote and executed the first Java program  
- Explored core concepts:  
  - **Variables & Data Types**  
  - **Operators & Expressions**  
  - **Conditional Statements**  
  - **Loops (for, while, do-while)**  

### 🛠️ Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Installed and configured JDK  
- ✅ Successfully wrote and ran my first Java program  
- ✅ Experimented with different data types and operators  
- ✅ Implemented loops for iteration and logic flow  

### 🔍 Insights & Challenges:
- Setting up the JDK was smooth after troubleshooting missing `javac`.  
- Loops helped simplify repetitive tasks—especially `for` and `while`.  
- Gained a better understanding of data types and expressions in Java.  

### 📜 Next Steps:
- Dive deeper into **functions and methods**.  
- Explore **object-oriented principles** in Java.  
- Keep refining coding practices with structured examples.
