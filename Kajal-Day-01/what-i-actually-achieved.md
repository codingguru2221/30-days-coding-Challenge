## **Date:** 2/4/2025  

### ~~~~~~~~~~ Tasks Archived Today ~~~~~~~~~~  

#### **React-JS**  
- ✅ Watched two React-JS tutorial videos from "Code with Harry".  
  - Learned:  
    - *What is the requirement of using React-JS*.  
    - How to install **Node.js** and extensions like **Thunder Client** and **Auto Rename Tag**.  
    - How to create React apps:  
      - **Permanent creation:** `npm create-react-app <filename>` command.  
      - **Temporary creation:** `npx create-react-app <filename>` command.  
    - Explored the important files in a created React app.  
    - Worked on implementing some key files.  

#### **Figma**  
- ❌ No practical work done in Figma today.  
  - Only watched a tutorial video for design analysis and understanding.  

### Reflection:  
Progress in React-JS was strong, while Figma efforts were focused on learning rather than practice. Tomorrow could be a great day to balance both!
