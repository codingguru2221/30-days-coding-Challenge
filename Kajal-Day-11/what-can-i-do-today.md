### Update:
No work was done today because my laptop is dead.

- Catch up on Day 11 topics:
  - âœ… Typecasting  
  - âœ… Recursion  
  - âœ… Class Attributes  
- Focus on frontend development:
  - ðŸŽ¯ Figma (UI/UX design basics & prototyping)  
  - ðŸŽ¯ React (components, hooks, props, state)  
  - ðŸŽ¯ More frontend topics (Tailwind CSS, responsive design, routing)

### Notes:
- Will adjust the schedule once the laptop is repaired.
- Consider doing design practice or theory reading until the laptop is functional.
