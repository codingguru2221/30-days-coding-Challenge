# 🚀 Day 10 - Java Research Topics (Coding Challenge)

Today is **Day 10** of my coding challenge! I'm diving into **Java** to explore its fundamentals and advanced capabilities. Here's a categorized list of topics I'm researching today:

---

## 🔰 Basics & Core Concepts
- [ ] Data Types & Variables  
- [ ] Control Flow (if-else, switch, loops)  
- [ ] Methods & Parameters  
- [ ] Arrays & Strings  

---

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [ ] Classes & Objects  
- [ ] Inheritance  
- [ ] Polymorphism (Overloading & Overriding)  
- [ ] Abstraction & Interfaces  
- [ ] Encapsulation  

---

## 🧰 Collections Framework
- [ ] List, Set, Map (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap)

- [ ] Multithreading & Concurrency  
- [ ] Lambda Expressions & Functional Interfaces  
- [ ] Streams API  

---

## 📦 Java APIs & Libraries
- [ ] File I/O (`java.io`, `java.nio`)  
- [ ] Date & Time API (`java.time`)  
- [ ] Regular Expressions  

---

## 🧪 Testing & Tools
