# 🚀 30 Days of Java Coding Challenge - Day 5

## 🔥 Topic of the Day: Loops and Conditional Statements

### ✅ Goals for the Day
- [ ] Understand `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops in Java.
- [ ] Learn how `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements work.
- [ ] Explore the use of `switch` statements.
- [ ] Implement loops to automate repetitive tasks.

### 📝 Tasks
