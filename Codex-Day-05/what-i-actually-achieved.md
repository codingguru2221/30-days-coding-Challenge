# 🚀 30 Days of Java Coding Challenge - Day 5

## 🔥 Topic of the Day: Loops and Conditional Statements

### ✅ Goals for the Day
- [x] Understand `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops in Java.  
- [x] Learn how `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements work.  
- [x] Explore the use of `switch` statements.  
- [x] Implement loops to automate repetitive tasks.

### 🧠 Fun Facts & Insights

- 🔁 **Loops** help reduce code duplication and are essential for tasks like iterating over arrays, collections, or performing an operation multiple times.
- 🕳️ **Infinite loops** can occur if the loop condition is never false — always double-check your logic!
- 🔄 `do-while` loops execute the code **at least once**, even if the condition is false the first time.
- 🔀 `switch` statements are internally optimized by Java using **jump tables** for performance (in most cases).
- 📊 Conditional logic is the **foundation of decision making** in programming — it helps your programs react dynamically to inputs and states.

### 📝 Tasks
- [x] Write a simple program using a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.  
- [x] Create a program using a `while` loop that prints even numbers up to 20.  
- [x] Design a basic calculator using `switch` statements.  
- [x] Solve at least one problem on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) related to loops.

### 📌 Notes
- Loops are essential for reducing redundancy in code.
- `for`, `while`, and `do-while` offer flexibility depending on control flow needs.
- `switch` statements simplify multiple conditional paths, especially for fixed choices.
- Loop-based challenges enhance logical thinking and efficiency in problem-solving.
